    "text": "Hyperparameter tuning is an important, but often difficult and computationally intensive task. Changing the architecture of a neural network or the learning rate of an optimizer can have a significant impact on the performance.\nThe goal of hyperparameter tuning is to optimize the hyperparameters in a way that improves the performance of the machine learning or deep learning model. The simplest, but also most computationally expensive, approach uses manual search (or trial-and-error (Meignan et al. 2015)). Commonly encountered is simple random search, i.e., random and repeated selection of hyperparameters for evaluation, and lattice search (“grid search”). In addition, methods that perform directed search and other model-free algorithms, i.e., algorithms that do not explicitly rely on a model, e.g., evolution strategies (Bartz-Beielstein et al. 2014) or pattern search (Lewis, Torczon, and Trosset 2000) play an important role. Also, “hyperband”, i.e., a multi-armed bandit strategy that dynamically allocates resources to a set of random configurations and uses successive bisections to stop configurations with poor performance (Li et al. 2016), is very common in hyperparameter tuning. The most sophisticated and efficient approaches are the Bayesian optimization and surrogate model based optimization methods, which are based on the optimization of cost functions determined by simulations or experiments.\nWe consider below a surrogate model based optimization-based hyperparameter tuning approach based on the Python version of the SPOT (“Sequential Parameter Optimization Toolbox”) (Bartz-Beielstein, Lasarczyk, and Preuss 2005), which is suitable for situations where only limited resources are available. This may be due to limited availability and cost of hardware, or due to the fact that confidential data may only be processed locally, e.g., due to legal requirements. Furthermore, in our approach, the understanding of algorithms is seen as a key tool for enabling transparency and explainability. This can be enabled, for example, by quantifying the contribution of machine learning and deep learning components (nodes, layers, split decisions, activation functions, etc.). Understanding the importance of hyperparameters and the interactions between multiple hyperparameters plays a major role in the interpretability and explainability of machine learning models. SPOT provides statistical tools for understanding hyperparameters and their interactions. Last but not least, it should be noted that the SPOT software code is available in the open source spotPython package on github1, allowing replicability of the results. This tutorial descries the Python variant of SPOT, which is called spotPython. The R implementation is described in Bartz et al. (2022). SPOT is an established open source software that has been maintained for more than 15 years (Bartz-Beielstein, Lasarczyk, and Preuss 2005) (Bartz et al. 2022).\nThis tutorial is structured as follows. The concept of the hyperparameter tuning software spotPython is described in Section 2. Section 3 describes the integration of spotPython into the PyTorch training workflow and presents the results. Finally, Section 4 presents a summary and an outlook.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe corresponding .ipynb notebook (Bartz-Beielstein 2023) is updated regularly and reflects updates and changes in the spotPython package. It can be downloaded from https://github.com/sequential-parameter-optimization/spotPython/blob/main/notebooks/14_spot_ray_hpt_torch_cifar10.ipynb."

We will show the implementation from PyTorch (2023a) in Section 3.5.1 first, before the extended implementation with spotPython is shown in Section 3.5.2.\n\nImplementing a Configurable Neural Network With Ray Tune\nWe used the same hyperparameters that are implemented as configurable in the PyTorch tutorial. We specify the layer sizes, namely l1 and l2, of the fully connected layers:\nclass Net(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, l1=120, l2=84):\n        super(Net, self).__init__()\n        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 6, 5)\n        self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(2, 2)\n        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(6, 16, 5)\n        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(16 * 5 * 5, l1)\n        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(l1, l2)\n        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(l2, 10)\n\n    def forward(self, x):\n        x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv1(x)))\n        x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv2(x)))\n        x = x.view(-1, 16 * 5 * 5)\n        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))\n        x = F.relu(self.fc2(x))\n        x = self.fc3(x)\n        return x\n\nThe learning rate, i.e., lr, of the optimizer is made configurable, too:\noptimizer = optim.SGD(net.parameters(), lr=config[\"lr\"], momentum=0.9)\n\n\nImplementing a Configurable Neural Network With spotPython\nspotPython implements a class which is similar to the class described in the PyTorch tutorial. The class is called Net_CIFAR10 and is implemented in the file netcifar10.py.\nimport spotPython.torch.netcore as netcore\nclass Net_CIFAR10(netcore.Net_Core):\n    def __init__(self, l1, l2, lr, batch_size, epochs, k_folds, patience):\n        super(Net_CIFAR10, self).__init__(\n            lr=lr, batch_size=batch_size, epochs=epochs, k_folds=k_folds,\n            patience=patience\n        )\n        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 6, 5)\n        self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(2, 2)\n        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(6, 16, 5)\n        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(16 * 5 * 5, l1)\n        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(l1, l2)\n        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(l2, 10)\n\n    def forward(self, x):\n        x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv1(x)))\n        x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv2(x)))\n        x = x.view(-1, 16 * 5 * 5)\n        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))\n        x = F.relu(self.fc2(x))\n        x = self.fc3(x)\n        return x\nNet_CIFAR10 inherits from the class Net_Core which is implemented in the file netcore.py. It implements the additional attributes that are common to all neural network models. The attributes are the learning rate lr, the batch size batch_size, the number of epochs epochs, the number of folds k_folds for the cross validation, and the patience patience for the early stopping. The class Net_Core is shown below.\nfrom torch import nn\n\n\nclass Net_Core(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, lr, batch_size, epochs, k_folds, patience):\n        super(Net_Core, self).__init__()\n        self.lr = lr\n        self.batch_size = batch_size\n        self.epochs = epochs\n        self.k_folds = k_folds\n        self.patience = patience\n\n\nComparison of the Approach Described in the PyTorch Tutorial With spotPython\nComparing the class Net from the PyTorch tutorial and the class Net_CIFAR10 from spotPython, we see that the class Net_CIFAR10 has additional attributes and does not inherit from nn directly. It adds an additional class, Net_core, that takes care of additional attributes that are common to all neural network models, e.g., the learning rate lr or the batch size batch_size.\nspotPython’s core_model implements an instance of the Net_CIFAR10 class. In addition to the basic neural network model, the core_model can use these additional attributes. spotPython provides methods for handling these additional attributes to guarantee 100% compatibility with the PyTorch classes. The method add_core_model_to_fun_control adds the hyperparameters and additional attributes to the fun_control dictionary. The method is shown below.\n\ncore_model = Net_CIFAR10\nfun_control = add_core_model_to_fun_control(core_model=core_model,\n                              fun_control=fun_control,\n                              hyper_dict=TorchHyperDict,\n                              filename=None)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn addition to the class Net from the PyTorch tutorial, the class Net_CIFAR10 has additional attributes, e.g.:\n\nlearning rate (lr),\nbatch size (batch_size),\nepochs (epochs),\nk_folds (k_folds), and\nearly stopping criterion “patience” (patience)\n\nFurther attributes can be easily added to the class, e.g., optimizer or loss_function."

    "section": "The Search Space",
    "text": "The Search Space\nIn Section 3.6.1, we first describe how to configure the search space with ray[tune] (as shown in PyTorch (2023a)) and then how to configure the search space with spotPython in Section 3.6.2.\n\nConfiguring the Search Space With Ray Tune\nRay Tune’s search space can be configured as follows (PyTorch 2023a):\nconfig = {\n    \"l1\": tune.sample_from(lambda _: 2**np.random.randint(2, 9)),\n    \"l2\": tune.sample_from(lambda _: 2**np.random.randint(2, 9)),\n    \"lr\": tune.loguniform(1e-4, 1e-1),\n    \"batch_size\": tune.choice([2, 4, 8, 16])\n}\nThe tune.sample_from() function enables the user to define sample methods to obtain hyperparameters. In this example, the l1 and l2 parameters should be powers of 2 between 4 and 256, so either 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, or 256. The lr (learning rate) should be uniformly sampled between 0.0001 and 0.1. Lastly, the batch size is a choice between 2, 4, 8, and 16.\nAt each trial, ray[tune] will randomly sample a combination of parameters from these search spaces. It will then train a number of models in parallel and find the best performing one among these. ray[tune] uses the ASHAScheduler which will terminate bad performing trials early.\n\n\nConfiguring the Search Space With spotPython\n\nThe hyper_dict Hyperparameters for the Selected Algorithm\nspotPython uses simple JSON files for the specification of the hyperparameters. Users can specify their individual JSON files, or they can use the JSON files provided by spotPython. The JSON file for the core_model is called torch_hyper_dict.json.\nIn contrast to ray[tune], spotPython can handle numerical, boolean, and categorical hyperparameters. They can be specified in the JSON file in a similar way as the numerical hyperparameters as shown below:\n\"factor_hyperparameter\": {\n    \"levels\": [\"A\", \"B\", \"C\"],\n    \"type\": \"factor\",\n    \"default\": \"B\",\n    \"transform\": \"None\",\n    \"core_model_parameter_type\": \"str\",\n    \"lower\": 0,\n    \"upper\": 2},\nEach entry in the JSON file represents one hyperparameter with the following structure: type, default, transform, lower, and upper. The corresponding entries for the Net_CIFAR10 class are shown below.\n{\"Net_CIFAR10\":\n    {\n        \"l1\": {\n            \"type\": \"int\",\n            \"default\": 5,\n            \"transform\": \"transform_power_2_int\",\n            \"lower\": 2,\n            \"upper\": 9},\n        \"l2\": {\n            \"type\": \"int\",\n            \"default\": 5,\n            \"transform\": \"transform_power_2_int\",\n            \"lower\": 2,\n            \"upper\": 9},\n        \"lr\": {\n            \"type\": \"float\",\n            \"default\": 1e-03,\n            \"transform\": \"None\",\n            \"lower\": 1e-05,\n            \"upper\": 1e-02},\n        \"batch_size\": {\n            \"type\": \"int\",\n            \"default\": 4,\n            \"transform\": \"transform_power_2_int\",\n            \"lower\": 1,\n            \"upper\": 4},\n        \"epochs\": {\n            \"type\": \"int\",\n            \"default\": 3,\n            \"transform\": \"transform_power_2_int\",\n            \"lower\": 1,\n            \"upper\": 4},\n        \"k_folds\": {\n            \"type\": \"int\",\n            \"default\": 2,\n            \"transform\": \"None\",\n            \"lower\": 2,\n            \"upper\": 3},\n        \"patience\": {\n            \"type\": \"int\",\n            \"default\": 5,\n            \"transform\": \"None\",\n            \"lower\": 2,\n            \"upper\": 10},\n        \"optimizer\": {\n            \"levels\": [\"Adadelta\",\n                       \"Adagrad\",\n                       \"Adam\",\n                       \"AdamW\",\n                       \"SparseAdam\",\n                       \"Adamax\",\n                       \"ASGD\",\n                       \"LBFGS\",\n                       \"NAdam\",\n                       \"RAdam\",\n                       \"RMSprop\",\n                       \"Rprop\",\n                       \"SGD\"],\n            \"type\": \"factor\",\n            \"default\": \"SGD\",\n            \"transform\": \"None\",\n            \"class_name\": \"torch.optim\",\n            \"core_model_parameter_type\": \"str\",\n            \"lower\": 0,\n            \"upper\": 12},\n        \"criterion\": {\n            \"levels\": [\"L1Loss\",\n                       \"MSELoss\",\n                       \"CrossEntropyLoss\",\n                       \"CTCLoss\",\n                       \"NLLLoss\",\n                       \"PoissonNLLLoss\",\n                       \"GaussianNLLLoss\",\n                       \"KLDivLoss\",\n                       \"BCELoss\",\n                       \"BCEWithLogitsLoss\",\n                       \"MarginRankingLoss\",\n                       \"HingeEmbeddingLoss\",\n                       \"MultiLabelMarginLoss\",\n                       \"HuberLoss\",\n                       \"SmoothL1Loss\",\n                       \"SoftMarginLoss\",\n                       \"MultiLabelSoftMarginLoss\",\n                       \"CosineEmbeddingLoss\",\n                       \"MultiMarginLoss\",\n                       \"TripletMarginLoss\",\n                       \"TripletMarginWithDistanceLoss\"],\n            \"type\": \"factor\",\n            \"default\": \"CrossEntropyLoss\",\n            \"transform\": \"None\",\n            \"class_name\": \"torch.nn\",\n            \"core_model_parameter_type\": \"instance()\",\n            \"lower\": 0,\n            \"upper\": 20}\n    }\n}"

    "section": "Modifying the Hyperparameters",
    "text": "Modifying the Hyperparameters\nRay tune (PyTorch 2023a) does not provide a way to change the specified hyperparameters without re-compilation. However, spotPython provides functions for modifying the hyperparameters, their bounds and factors as well as for activating and de-activating hyperparameters without re-compilation of the Python source code. These functions are described in the following.\n\nModify hyper_dict Hyperparameters for the Selected Algorithm aka core_model\nAfter specifying the model, the corresponding hyperparameters, their types and bounds are loaded from the JSON file torch_hyper_dict.json. After loading, the user can modify the hyperparameters, e.g., the bounds. spotPython provides a simple rule for de-activating hyperparameters: If the lower and the upper bound are set to identical values, the hyperparameter is de-activated. This is useful for the hyperparameter tuning, because it allows to specify a hyperparameter in the JSON file, but to de-activate it in the fun_control dictionary. This is done in the next step.\n\n\nModify Hyperparameters of Type numeric and integer (boolean)\nSince the hyperparameter k_folds is not used in the PyTorch tutorial, it is de-activated here by setting the lower and upper bound to the same value. Note, k_folds is of type “integer”.\n\nfun_control = modify_hyper_parameter_bounds(fun_control, \"batch_size\", bounds=[1, 5])\nfun_control = modify_hyper_parameter_bounds(fun_control, \"k_folds\", bounds=[0, 0])\nfun_control = modify_hyper_parameter_bounds(fun_control, \"patience\", bounds=[3, 3])\nfun_control[\"core_model_hyper_dict\"]\n\n\n\nModify Hyperparameter of Type factor\nIn a similar manner as for the numerical hyperparameters, the categorical hyperparameters can be modified. New configurations can be chosen by adding or deleting levels. For example, the hyperparameter optimizer can be re-configured as follows:\nIn the following setting, two optimizers (\"SGD\" and \"Adam\") will be compared during the spotPython hyperparameter tuning. The hyperparameter optimizer is active.\n\nfun_control = modify_hyper_parameter_levels(fun_control, \"optimizer\", [\"SGD\", \"Adam\"])\n\nThe hyperparameter optimizer can be de-activated by choosing only one value (level), here: \"SGD\".\n\nfun_control = modify_hyper_parameter_levels(fun_control, \"optimizer\", [\"SGD\"])\n\nAs discussed in Section 3.7.4, there are some issues with the LBFGS optimizer. Therefore, the usage of the LBFGS optimizer is not deactivated in spotPython by default. However, the LBFGS optimizer can be activated by adding it to the list of optimizers. Rprop was remmoved, because it does perform very poorly (as some pre-tests have shown). However, it can also be activated by adding it to the list of optimizers. Since SparseAdam does not support dense gradients, Adam was used instead. Therefore, there are 10 default optimizers:\n\nfun_control = modify_hyper_parameter_levels(fun_control, \"optimizer\",[\"Adadelta\",\n     \"Adagrad\", \"Adam\", \"AdamW\", \"Adamax\", \"ASGD\", \"NAdam\", \"RAdam\",\n      \"RMSprop\", \"SGD\"])\n\n\n\nOptimizers\nTable 1 shows some of the optimizers available in PyTorch:\n\n\nTable 1: Optimizers available in PyTorch (selection). “mom” denotes momentum, “weight” weight_decay, “damp” dampening, “nest” nesterov, and “lr_sc” learning rate for scaling delta.

The PyTorch documentation, see https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.optim.LBFGS.html#torch.optim.LBFGS, states:\n\nThis is a very memory intensive optimizer (it requires additional param_bytes * (history_size + 1) bytes). If it doesn’t fit in memory try reducing the history size, or use a different algorithm.\n\nFurthermore, the LBFGS optimizer is not compatible with the PyTorch tutorial. The reason is that the LBFGS optimizer requires the closure function, which is not implemented in the PyTorch tutorial. Therefore, the LBFGS optimizer is recommended here.\n\n\nSince there are 10 optimizers in the portfolio, it is not recommended tuning the hyperparameters that effect one single optimizer only. Thus, the learning rate, which affects the SGD optimizer, will be set to a fixed value. We choose the default value of 1e-3 for the learning rate, because it is used in other PyTorch examples. We recommend tuning the learning rate later, when a reduced set of optimizers is fixed. Here, we will demonstrate how to select in a screening phase the optimizers that should be used for the hyperparameter tuning.\n\nfun_control = modify_hyper_parameter_bounds(fun_control, \"lr\", bounds=[1e-3, 1e-3])"

    "section": "Evaluation",
    "text": "Evaluation\nThe evaluation procedure requires the specification of two elements:\n\nthe way how the data is split into a train and a test set and\nthe loss function (and a metric).\n\n\nHold-out Data Split and Cross-Validation\nAs a default, spotPython provides a standard hold-out data split and cross validation.\n\nHold-out Data Split\nIf a hold-out data split is used, the data will be partitioned into a training, a validation, and a test data set. The split depends on the setting of the eval parameter. If eval is set to train_hold_out, one data set, usually the original training data set, is split into a new training and a validation data set. The training data set is used for training the model. The validation data set is used for the evaluation of the hyperparameter configuration and early stopping to prevent overfitting. In this case, the original test data set is not used. The following splits are performed in the hold-out setting: \\(\\{\\text{train}_0, \\text{test}\\} \\rightarrow \\{\\text{train}_1, \\text{validation}_1, \\text{test}\\}\\), where \\(\\text{train}_1 \\cup \\text{validation}_1 = \\text{train}_0\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nspotPython returns the hyperparameters of the machine learning and deep learning models, e.g., number of layers, learning rate, or optimizer, but not the model weights. Therefore, after the SPOT run is finished, the corresponding model has to be trained again with the best hyperparameter configuration. The training is performed on the training data set. The test data set is used for the final evaluation of the model.\nSummarizing, the following splits are performed in the hold-out setting:\n\nRun spotPython with eval set to train_hold_out to determine the best hyperparameter configuration.\nTrain the model with the best hyperparameter configuration on the training data set:\n\ntrain_save(model_spot, train, \"model_spot.pt\").\n\nTest the model on the test data:\n\ntest_saved(model_spot, test, \"model_spot.pt\")\n\n\nThese steps will be exemplified in the following sections.\n\n\nIn addition to this hold-out setting, spotPython provides another hold-out setting, where an explicit test data is specified by the user that will be used as the validation set. To choose this option, the eval parameter is set to test_hold_out. In this case, the training data set is used for the model training. Then, the explicitly defined test data set is used for the evaluation of the hyperparameter configuration (the validation).\n\n\nCross-Validation\nThe cross validation setting is used by setting the eval parameter to train_cv or test_cv. In both cases, the data set is split into \\(k\\) folds. The model is trained on \\(k-1\\) folds and evaluated on the remaining fold. This is repeated \\(k\\) times, so that each fold is used exactly once for evaluation. The final evaluation is performed on the test data set. The cross validation setting is useful for small data sets, because it allows to use all data for training and evaluation. However, it is computationally expensive, because the model has to be trained \\(k\\) times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nCombinations of the above settings are possible, e.g., cross validation can be used for training and hold-out for evaluation or . Also, cross validation can be used for training and testing. Because cross validation is not used in the PyTorch tutorial (PyTorch 2023a), it is not considered further here.\n\n\n\n\n\nLoss Functions and Metrics\nThe key \"criterion\" specifies the loss function which is used during the optimization. There are several different loss functions under PyTorch’s nn package. For example, a simple loss is MSELoss, which computes the mean-squared error between the output and the target. In this tutorial we will use CrossEntropyLoss, because it is also used in the PyTorch tutorial.\n\nfun_control = modify_hyper_parameter_levels(fun_control, \"criterion\", [\"CrossEntropyLoss\"])\n\nIn addition to the loss functions, spotPython provides access to a large number of metrics. The key \"metric_sklearn\" is used for metrics that follow the scikit-learn conventions4. Because the PyTorch tutorial uses the accuracy as metric, we use the same metric here. Currently, accuracy is computed in the tutorial’s example code. Therefore, we will use the same implementation here and set the key \"metric_sklearn\" to None.\n\nweights = 1.0\ncriterion = CrossEntropyLoss\nshuffle = True\neval = \"train_hold_out\"\ndevice = DEVICE\nshow_batch_interval = 100_000\nsave_model = True\npath=\"torch_model.pt\"\n\nfun_control.update({\n               \"data_dir\": None,\n               \"checkpoint_dir\": None,\n               \"horizon\": None,\n               \"oml_grace_period\": None,\n               \"weights\": weights,\n               \"step\": None,\n               \"log_level\": 50,\n               \"weight_coeff\": None,\n               \"metric\": None,\n               \"metric_sklearn\": None,\n               \"criterion\": criterion,\n               \"shuffle\": shuffle,\n               \"eval\": eval,\n               \"device\": device,\n               \"show_batch_interval\": show_batch_interval,\n               \"save_model\": save_model,\n               \"path\": path,\n               })"

The surrogate model based optimization-optimization with the surrogate refines the results.

The surrogate model based optimization is considered to be more efficient than a random search, because the surrogate model guides the search towards promising regions in the hyperparameter space.\nIn addition to the improved (“optimized”) hyperparameter values, spotPython allows a statistical analysis, e.g., a sensitivity analysis, of the results.

For this, again refer to the notebook (Bartz-Beielstein 2023).\n\n\nthreshold = 0.025\nimpo = spot_tuner.print_importance(threshold=threshold, print_screen=True)\nvar_plots = [i for i, x in enumerate(impo) if x[1] &gt; threshold]\nmin_z = min(spot_tuner.y)\nmax_z = max(spot_tuner.y)\nn = spot_tuner.k\nfor i in var_plots:\n    for j in var_plots:\n        if j &gt; i:\n            filename = \"./figures\" + experiment_name+\"_contour_\"+str(i)+\"_\"+str(j)+\".pdf\"\n            spot_tuner.plot_contour(i=i, j=j, min_z=min_z, max_z = max_z, filename=filename)\nFigure 4: ?(caption)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Contour plot of the loss as a function of l1 and l2, i.e., the number of neurons in the layers.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Contour plot of the loss as a function of the number of epochs and the neurons in layer l1.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Contour plot of the loss as a function of the optimizer and the neurons in layer l1.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Contour plot of the loss as a function of the number of epochs and the neurons in layer l2.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Contour plot of the loss as a function of the optimizer and the neurons in layer l2.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Contour plot of the loss as a function of the optimizer and the number of epochs.\n\n\nFigure 5 to Figure 10 show the contour plots of the loss as a function of the hyperparameters. These plots are very helpful for benchmark studies and for understanding neural networks. spotPython provides additional tools for a visual inspection of the results and give valuable insights into the hyperparameter tuning process. This is especially useful for model explainability, transparency, and trustworthiness. In addition to the contour plots, Figure 12 shows the parallel plot of the hyperparameters.\n\n\nspot_tuner.parallel_plot()\nFigure 11: ?(caption)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12: Parallel plot"
