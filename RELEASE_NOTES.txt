spotpython 0.17.2:


- trainmodel.py:
    Tensorboard logger uses the argument name="".

    doumentation updated

- init.py:
    fun_control_init() function accepts additional arguments for Lightning.


spotpython-0.17.1

- improved get_device function

spotpython-0.17.0

- designs.py and spacefilling.py:
Naming Conventions: The class names have been capitalized to follow the PEP 8 convention for class naming:
1. `designs` -> `Designs`
2. `spacefilling` -> `SpaceFilling`

- The dimension of the design, k (int), must be specified by the user. There is not default dimension "2" anymore.


spotpython-0.16.19:

- kriging.py update completed

spotpython-0.16.15:

- initialize_matrices:
1. Simplified Penalty Calculation: Cached the variance calculation to a variable for clean reuse; reused it to set `pen_val` with efficient branching.
2. Consistent Attribute Initialization: Set `dtype` for arrays like `self.one` for float precision; ensured all attributes are either properly initialized or set to `None`.


spotpython-0.16.14:

- spotpython.utils.aggregate.py: aggregate_mean_var() updated:
    1. Imports: Ensured that necessary imports (`numpy` and `pandas`) are included.
    2. Input Validation: Added checks to ensure that `X` and `y` are `numpy` arrays, `X` is 2D, `y` is 1D, and they have matching shapes, helping prevent common input errors.
    3. Use of Pandas Group Functionality: Improved grouping and aggregation by explicitly handling multi-index resulting from `agg`.
    4. Return Type Consistency: Ensured that the description in the documentation matches the actual operation and expected shapes for return arrays `y_mean` and `y_var`.

- initialize_variables:
    1. Input Validation: Added checks to ensure correct shapes for `nat_X` and `nat_y`, which prevent unexpected errors during execution.
    2. Proper Initialization Instead of Assigning in Tuples: Decomposed the tuple assignment directly for clarity.

- set_variable_types:
    1. Corrected Initialization of `var_type`: If the length of `var_type` is less than `k`, the variable types are now all set to `'num'` consistently, rather than attempting to multiply the list.
    2. NumPy Vectorization: Moved from `map` and list comprehension to NumPy vectorized operations, which are more efficient and readable when handling large data.
    3. Simplified Ordered Mask Logic: Used NumPy's `isin` function, which directly checks membership in a list of types relevant for `ordered_mask`.


spotpython-0.16.12:

- kriging.py: method extract_from_bounds() updated.

spotpython-0.16.11:

- documentation: update documentation of the Kriging class

spotpython-0.16.10:

- documentation: update documentation of the Kriging class

spotpython-0.16.9:

- xai.py: add new function viz_net to visualize the network architecture (linear nets)
- dimensions.py: add new function extract_linear_dims that extracts the input and output dimensions of the Linear layers in a PyTorch model.

spotpython-0.16.8:

- xai.py: automatically handle the orientation of the colorbar in the plot_nn_values_scatter function
